                A film, also known as a movie or motion picture, a is a work of visual art that simulates experiences
                and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, emotions, or atmosphere through the use of
                moving images that are generally, since the 1930s, synchronized with sound and (less commonly) other
                sensory stimulations. The word "cinema" is orrowed from the French cinéma, an abbreviation of
                cinématographe (term coined by the Lumière brothers in the 1890s), from Ancient Greek meaning "recording
                movement". The word is today usually used to refer to either a purpose-built venue for screening films,
                known as a movie theater in the US; the film industry; the overall art form; or filmmaking.
