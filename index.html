            <h2>He/Him</h2>
            <p>I'm Rhys Durando and I come from Dingwall, a rural Cape Breton village, where the ratio of churches to residents was 3:1 and the only entertainment you could get is skipping rocks and pestering tourists. My house was <b>empty</b> <i>and</i> secluded deep in a forest and that feeling was only magnified during the brutal winters that would send you into lock down in your own house for a week and without power for even longer.</p>
